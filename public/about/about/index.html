<p>I am a Staff Software Engineer at Reddit working in the Caching &amp;
Storage Infra Org.
My current work involves providing Redis as an infrastructure
using Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked with Meta/Facebook on their low-dependency
metadata storage system called DelosTable. This
system provides a table-like(Relational) abstraction to our
customers requiring a highly available linearizable store.</p>
<p>Before that I was working at OfferUp handling the Identity &amp; User
Domain.</p>

<h2 id="non-professional">Non-Professional</h2>
<p>In my free time, I am writing my own Replicated Database. It is still
in its infancy but has a Multi-Paxos Implementation for Log with
dynamic reconfiguration, provides table abstraction using RocksDb, and
uses Apache Arrow for query execution and data handling.

big ideas are meticulously documented in Google Docs, and I plan to
merge them with code in the future)
I am deeply passionate about Distributed Database Systems and would
like to continue this journey.</p>
